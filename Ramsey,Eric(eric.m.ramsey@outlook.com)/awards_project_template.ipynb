    "The purpose of this project is to gauge your technical skills and problem solving ability by working through something similar to a real NBA data science project. You will work your way through this jupyter notebook, answering questions as you go along. Please begin by adding your name to the top markdown chunk in this document. When you're finished with the document, come back and type your answers into the answer key at the top. Please leave all your work below and have your answers where indicated below as well. Please note that we will be reviewing your code so make it clear, concise and avoid long printouts. Feel free to add in as many new code chunks as you'd like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that we will be grading the quality of your code and visuals alongside the correctness of your answers. Please try to use packages like pandas/numpy and matplotlib/seaborn as much as possible (instead of base python data manipulations and explicit loops.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**WARNING:** Your project will **ONLY** be graded if it's knit to an HTML document where we can see your code. Be careful to make sure that any long lines of code appropriately visibly wrap around visibly to the next line, as code that's cut off from the side of the document cannot be graded.  \n",

    "**Note:**    \n",

    "**Throughout this document, any `season` column represents the year each season started. For example, the 2015-16 season will be in the dataset as 2015. For most of the rest of the project, we will refer to a season by just this number (e.g. 2015) instead of the full text (e.g. 2015-16).** "

    "\n",
    "You're going to work to create a dataset with a \"career outcome\" for each player, representing the highest level of success that the player achieved for **at least two** seasons *after his first four seasons in the league* (examples to follow below!). To do this, you'll start with single season level outcomes. On a single season level, the outcomes are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Elite: A player is \"Elite\" in a season if he won any All NBA award (1st, 2nd, or 3rd team), MVP, or DPOY in that season.    \n",
    "- All-Star: A player is \"All-Star\" in a season if he was selected to be an All-Star that season.   \n",
    "- Starter:  A player is a \"Starter\" in a season if he started in at least 41 games in the season OR if he played at least 2000 minutes in the season.    \n",
    "- Rotation:  A player is a \"Rotation\" player in a season if he played at least 1000 minutes in the season.   \n",
    "- Roster:  A player is a \"Roster\" player in a season if he played at least 1 minute for an NBA team but did not meet any of the above criteria.     \n",
    "- Out of the League: A player is \"Out of the League\" if he is not in the NBA in that season.   \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to make an adjustment for determining Starter/Rotation qualifications for a few seasons that didn't have 82 games per team. Assume that there were 66 possible games in the 2011 lockout season and 72 possible games in each of the 2019 and 2020 seasons that were shortened due to covid. Specifically, if a player played 900 minutes in 2011, he **would** meet the rotation criteria because his final minutes would be considered to be 900 * (82/66) = 1118. Please use this math for both minutes and games started, so a player who started 38 games in 2019 or 2020 would be considered to have started 38 * (82/72) = 43 games, and thus would qualify for starting 41. Any answers should be calculated assuming you round the multiplied values to the nearest whole number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that on a season level, a player's outcome is the highest level of success he qualifies for in that season. Thus, since Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was both All-NBA 1st team and an All-Star last year, he would be considered to be \"Elite\" for the 2022 season, but would still qualify for a career outcome of All-Star if in the rest of his career he made one more All-Star game but no more All-NBA teams. Note this is a hypothetical, and Shai has not yet played enough to have a career outcome.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- A player who enters the league as a rookie and has season outcomes of Roster (1), Rotation (2), Rotation (3), Roster (4), Roster (5), Out of the League (6+) would be considered \"Out of the League,\" because after his first four seasons, he only has a single Roster year, which does not qualify him for any success outcome.  \n",
    "- A player who enters the league as a rookie and has season outcomes of Roster (1), Rotation (2), Starter (3), Starter (4), Starter (5), Starter (6), All-Star (7), Elite (8), Starter (9) would be considered \"All-Star,\" because he had at least two seasons after his first four at all-star level of production or higher.  \n",
    "- A player who enters the league as a rookie and has season outcomes of Roster (1), Rotation (2), Starter (3), Starter (4), Starter (5), Starter (6), Rotation (7), Rotation (8), Roster (9) would be considered a \"Starter\" because he has two seasons after his first four at a starter level of production. \n"

    "### Open Ended Modeling Question   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, you will work to build a model to predict a player's career outcome based on information up through the first four years of his career. \n",
    "\n",
    "This question is intentionally left fairly open ended, but here are some notes and specifications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We know modeling questions can take a long time, and that qualified candidates will have different levels of experience with \"formal\" modeling. Don't be discouraged. It's not our intention to make you spend excessive time here. If you get your model to a good spot but think you could do better by spending a lot more time, you can just write a bit about your ideas for future improvement and leave it there. Further, we're more interested in your thought process and critical thinking than we are in specific modeling techniques. Using smart features is more important than using fancy mathematical machinery, and a successful candidate could use a simple regression approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. You may use any data provided in this project, but please do not bring in any external sources of data. Note that while most of the data provided goes back to 2007, All NBA and All Rookie team voting is only included back to 2011.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. A player needs to complete three additional seasons after their first four to be considered as having a distinct career outcome for our dataset. Because the dataset in this project ends in 2021, this means that a player would need to have had the chance to play in the '21, '20, and '19 seasons after his first four years, and thus his first four years would have been '18, '17, '16, and '15. **For this reason, limit your training data to players who were drafted in or before the 2015 season.** Karl-Anthony Towns was the #1 pick in that season.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Once you build your model, predict on all players who were drafted in 2018-2021 (They have between 1 and 4 seasons of data available and have not yet started accumulating seasons that inform their career outcome).  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. You can predict a single career outcome for each player, but it's better if you can predict the probability that each player falls into each outcome bucket.    \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Include, as part of your answer:  \n",
    "  - A brief written overview of how your model works, targeted towards a decision maker in the front office without a strong statistical background. \n",
    "  - What you view as the strengths and weaknesses of your model.  \n",
    "  - How you'd address the weaknesses if you had more time and or more data.  \n",
    "  - A matplotlib or plotly visualization highlighting some part of your modeling process, the model itself, or your results.  \n",
    "  - Your predictions for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Zion Williamson, James Wiseman, and Josh Giddey.  \n",
    "  - (Bonus!) An html table (for example, see the package `reactable`) containing all predictions for the players drafted in 2019-2021.  \n",

Although I've implemented the necessary data frames. I noticed during troubleshooting the errors I was getting that I unfortunately have two 'nbapersonid' columns indicating a logical error in my merge function.\n",

    "One characteristic of our current model that I would consider implementing is to retrieve injury report data or any indication that a player whose minutes per game is greater than 10 minutes. This would allow our model's predictions to consider players that potentially have a high impact on OKC's overall offensive rebounding and rebounding percentages. Another implementation that could benefit the accuracy of our model's predictions would be to allow our model to have access to smaller sets of data, as well as the data already obtained. For example, if we allow our model to have access to the current rebounding data as well as smaller data sets containing the team’s rebounding averages in the past 10 games, this could increase the accuracy of the predictions as well as take into consideration of the more recent rebounding performance of the team."

You may either explain a weakness and discuss how you'd fix that weakness, then move onto the next issue, or you can start by explaining multiple weaknesses with the original approach and discuss one overall modeling methodology you'd use that gets around most or all of them.

    "<strong><span style=\"color:red\">ANSWER 3:</span></strong>  I feel that the first potential weakness of the model would be that the model doesn't necessarily compare OKC's rebounding performance and averages against the oppenent the team is facing in the upcoming game. It would benefit the model's predictions to implement a feature that would allow the model to take in consideration how the team has performed against the upcoming opponent in the past. Another potential weakness of the current model is not because the upcoming opponent may have key players that highly contribute to rebounding who might not be participating in the next game against OKC. I did discuss this in the previous question, however implementing a feature that also determines if players in the upcoming game that is being predicted have key players that are unable to contribute to rebound changes would change the odds in the game. Therefore, considering this would be an important factor in predicting OKC's overall rebounding (and overall game) performance. The final potential weakness that I feel could be considered for model improvement is the type of defense the opposing team plays, which should be considered when determining offensive rebounds for OKC. If a team tends to switch up a defensive formation or favors a zone defensive formation, this could impact the overall offensive rebounding performance for OKC. Finding a method to determine the defensive tactics of the opposing team and taking that into consideration could benefit the performance and predictions of the current model."
